'''cleverKeys is meant to improve setting keys intuitively in Maya.

If the mouse is over the graph editor, and a curve is selected, it keys
the attribute of the curve, otherwise, it keys the attributes selected
there. If the mouse is not over the graph editor, it keys the attributes
selected in the channel box.  If the channelBox is closed it will key
all the attributes on the selected node.  It attempts to use the "Insert
Key" function which makes keys match the curvature of the surrounding
keys whenever possible.  To use this module, call setKey()

    '''Sets clever keys.  Hohoho.

    If the mouse is over the graph editor, it keys the attributes
    selected there.  Otherwise it keys the attributes selected in the
    channel box. If the channelBox is closed it will key all the
    attributes on the selected node.  By default this uses the "Insert
    Key" behavior of Maya which makes keys match the curvature of the
    surrounding keys whenever possible.  Set insert parameter to false
    to disable this behavior.


    Parameters
    ----------
    insert : bool
        If true, uses the "insert key" behavior of Maya when creating keys.
        In this mode, key tangents will match any existing curves leaving
        them undisturbed.
    useSelectedCurves : bool
        If true, when an entire animation curve is selected in the graph
        editor (by clicking on the curve, not a key or tangent, or
        selecting every keyframe on the curve), then a key will only be
        inserted on the curves, other visible curves will be left alone.
    usePartialCurveSelection : bool
        This modifies the behavior of useSelectedCurves, and only
        affects behavior when that parameter is true as well. When true,
        this changes useSelectedCurves, so that selecting any part of a
        curve will limit keys to that curve (you do not need to select
        the entire curve).  Unselected curves will be left alone.
